  <li>How to use Github with Eclipse</li>
  <li>Beginning git</li>
</div>

<p>There are many ways to accomplish this task, but I&#39;ve chosen to incorporate <a href="http://www.aptana.com">Aptana</a>
into my Adobe development environments. Aptana Studio is known as a Rails-oriented plug in for Eclipse, 
but I started using it for it&#39;s strong JavaScript support. It happens to have one of the more straightforward 
Git connectors.</p>
<h2>Install Aptana for ColdFusion Builder</h2>
<p>For this guide, it does not matter whether you&#39;ve installed ColdFusion Builder as a standalone product 
or as an Eclipse plug in. Both versions run on Eclipse, meaning both have the ability to install Eclipse 
plug ins.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em>
<em>Your installation must be in a location with local administrative privileges, or at least healthy write privileges.</em>
<em>In my first attempt, I tried installing ColdFusion Builder on a Windows 7 system controlled by Active Directory.</em>
<em>While I was able to install everything with elevated privileges, I could not run it with elevated privileges. As a</em> 
<em>result, everything appeared to work, until trying to sync with Github. At this point, it simply failed to sync with</em> 
<em>permission issues. If anyone has insight on how to fix that with an unprivileged account, I&#39;d love to hear about it.</em></p>
<p>The simplest way to install Aptana Studio is through the Eclipse update feature. In ColdFusion/Flash Builder, this is found under:</p>
<p><code>Help → Install New Software</code></p>
<p>This brings up the installation screen. You&#39;ll need to add the Aptana Studio update site to the list by clicking on 
the Add button. Provide a name and the location of the update site as shown below:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="http"><span class="attribute">Name</span>: <span class="string">Aptana</span>
<span class="attribute">Location</span>: <span class="string">http://download.aptana.com/studio3/plugin/install</span></code></pre>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6107/6236940312_d8fc3e39b4.jpg" alt="Add Repository"></p>
<p>If prompted, restart ColdFusion Builder.</p>
<p><em>With some installations, I&#39;ve had some issues using the</em> <code>Apply Changes Now</code> <em>option.</em></p>
<p>Aptana may prompt you to install msysgit, which will work, but I recommend using the
<a href="http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git">Setup Git page</a> for installing Git on your computer anyway. 
There may be times, especially while learning, where you may wish to use Git from the command line. 
It is also helpful in creating the SSH keys you&#39;ll need to connect to Github. Regardless of your 
choice, you should be able to create local Git repositories at this point.</p>
<h3>Quick Aside</h3>
<p>For those new to Git, it is a source code management system. It works differently from CVS, 
Subversion, or SourceSafe. One important note is that you cannot directly connect to remote/hosted
repositories like Github/BitBucket. All communication with these remote repositories is handled by
a local repository stored on your computer. Aptana Studio and other Git tools help by auto-creating
local repositories as well as communicating with remote repositories.</p>
<h2>Connecting your project to Git</h2>
<p>Right-click on the project you want to associate with Git and select <code>Team → Share Project</code>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6038/6236417285_17cbdc284b_b.jpg" alt="Share Project"></p>
<p>You&#39;ll be prompted for a repository type, which should be <em>Aptana Git</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6101/6236940356_9cab34fcac.jpg" alt="Aptana Git"></p>
<p>Next, the wizard will help create a local Git repository.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6215/6236417315_5001425be4_b.jpg" alt="Local Git Repo"></p>
<p>Select the Project and click the <em>Create</em> button. This will create your local Git 
repository. Then click finish. At this point, you&#39;ve created your first Git repository! Now 
it&#39;s time to clean things up so our repository stays tidy.</p>
<h2>Ignore Files</h2>
<p>Git uses a file called <code>.gitignore</code> to prevent certain files/directories from being included 
in your repository. It&#39;s typically good form to not include your <code>.gitignore</code> file in your 
repository, so step one is to make it ignore itself. Ignoring files and directories is pretty 
straightforward. Simply right click the file name and <code>Add to .gitignore</code>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6036/6236417341_811c692821_b.jpg" alt="Add to gitignore"></p>
<p>It may be desirable to add wild card entries to your <code>.gitignore</code> file as well. For example, 
Eclipse users will be familiar with the .project file, and you may also see a <code>.git</code> directory 
in your project. I find it useful to ignore every file/directory in my project, as well as files 
that aren&#39;t relevant to my project (like <code>.thumb</code>). Gitignore, which is just a text file, can be 
edited to support wild cards. You can add the following:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="haskell">.*
<span class="title">_</span>*
<span class="title">settings</span>.xml</code></pre>
<p>This would ignore all files/directories that start with a dot or underscore, such as <code>.project</code>, 
<code>.git</code>, or <code>_NOTES</code>. It will also ignore the XML metadata settings file most Adobe products use 
to manage a project. As a result, these files will not end up in your remote project repository.</p>
<h3>Using Github</h3>
<p>Github is just one of several Git services, but it is extremely popular. It&#39;s free for open source
projects and inexpensive for private projects. <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a> is an 
alternative that has free open and private projects in addition to a commercial service. Setup between 
the two is similar, but we&#39;ll stick to Github for this tutorial.</p>
<p>First, you must have a personal Github account, so sign up for a free account. Next, you&#39;ll need an 
SSH key to connect with your repositories. You&#39;ll need an SSH key on every computer you work on. 
Github allows you to add multiple keys, so I have repeated the same process on my laptop, desktops, 
and workstations.</p>
<p>The simplest and most common way to create an SSH key and add it to your Github account is described 
in detail at <a href="http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/"><a href="http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git">http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git</a></a>. 
<em>This is the recommended method.</em></p>
<h2>Add a Repository</h2>
<p>If you haven&#39;t already, create a Github repository. This is done from the Dashboard of your Github 
account:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6234/6236417409_ef8d3e5e54_b.jpg" alt="Git Repo"></p>
<p>I recommend starting with a free open source repository until you&#39;re comfortable with how everything works.</p>
<h2>Connecting Your Project to Github with Aptana</h2>
<p>At this point, you should have a Github repository created on Github.com and a local repository
associated with your project. It&#39;s time to tie the two of them together.</p>
<p>The Aptana plug in provides a menu option for adding a remote repository, but I have had limited 
success with this. Therefore, I&#39;m going to show how to manually configure a remote connection to 
Github.</p>
<h3>Manual Remote Repository Configuration</h3>
<p>In your project directory, you should see a <code>.git</code> directory. If you&#39;re working on a Mac, this 
directory may be hidden. This directory contains a file called config, which needs to be modified. 
When you open the file, you will see a core attribute only. We need to add a remote connection and 
identify the master branch, as shown below. For copy/paste purposes, I&#39;ve provided a demo config below:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="ini"><span class="title">[core]</span>
<span class="setting">repositoryformatversion = <span class="value"><span class="number">0</span></span></span>
<span class="setting">filemode = <span class="value"><span class="keyword">false</span></span></span>
<span class="setting">bare = <span class="value"><span class="keyword">false</span></span></span>
<span class="setting">logallrefupdates = <span class="value"><span class="keyword">true</span></span></span>
<span class="setting">symlinks = <span class="value"><span class="keyword">false</span></span></span>
<span class="setting">ignorecase = <span class="value"><span class="keyword">true</span></span></span>
<span class="setting">hideDotFiles = <span class="value">dotGitOnly</span></span>

<span class="title">[remote "Test"]</span>
<span class="setting">url = <span class="value">git@github.com:mygithubname/myrepository.git</span></span>
<span class="setting">fetch = <span class="value">+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/test/*</span></span>

<span class="title">[branch "master"]</span>
<span class="setting">remote = <span class="value">Test</span></span>
<span class="setting">merge = <span class="value">refs/heads/master</span></span></code></pre>
<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6047/6236940446_012955e94f_b.jpg" alt="Git Config"></p>
<p>Save this file and you&#39;re done.</p>
<h2>Using Github</h2>
<p><em>Push &amp; Pull:</em></p>
<p>Assuming you followed this guide and configured everything correctly, you should be able to push and 
pull from your remote repository. However; you first need to commit changes to your local repository. 
Remember, all interaction with a remote repository is done through your local repository. If there are 
no changes committed to your local repository, then no changes will be pushed to your remote repository. 
The advantage of doing this is you can make as many changes as you like before sharing with other 
developers. That means you can screw up and fix as much as you like before ever publishing to the world.
Once you&#39;ve added some files to your project and are ready to push them to Github, right-click on the 
project and go to <code>Team → Commit</code>.</p>
<p>You will need to stage any/all changes you&#39;ve made and add a message, as shown below:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6236940458_35433d5ca2_b.jpg"><img align="middle" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6236940458_35433d5ca2_b.jpg" alt="Commit" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Click on the Commit button to save your changes in your <em>local</em> Git repository.</p>
<p>Now you can push your changes to Github. To do this, right click on the project and go to:
<code>Team → Push To Remote</code></p>
<p>Select the remote repository that was configured in prior steps.<br/>
<img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6033/6236940472_a592a09256_b.jpg" alt="Push to Remote" width="500" /></p>
<p>Once you push to the remote repository, you should see progress in the output console (if you have it open). Please note that the first time you push to a remote repository, it may be quite slow. You will also be prompted to accept the RSA fingerprint from Github (which you must do). This will add Github to your Known Hosts file if it isn&#39;t already there.
Finally, go check out your Github page. You should see your code there.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Now that you have a project working with Github, you should start to use the features and get familiar 
with it. Browse the documentation the Github website. Github has several interesting hooks and features 
that make it useful. A common feature is the Readme.md file. Github uses &quot;Github Flavored Markdown&quot; to 
create visually appealing documentation. If a Readme.md file is found in your project root, it will 
automatically be displayed on the page. This is how many developers provide introductory notes about 
their project for the community. Of course this can be expanded through use of the wiki or pages.
I anticipate covering Github issues and how to integrate Github issue management directly into 
ColdFusion/Flash/Eclipse Builder in an upcoming post.</p>
